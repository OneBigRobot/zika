## How to update

TODO Include directions here on how future editors can update this graphic. Is there a Google Spreadsheet? Do you need to install specific programs to run the scripts?

## Data sources

TODO Add information on where the data came from and any relevant information about it. Is a certain year missing for some reason? Did a contact send the raw data? Was it scraped?


### Data directory

Data files inside of this graphic's "data/" directory are automatically
available for Swig use inside of template files. The variables inside
Swig are based on the filenames.

For example, a file named "candidates.json" would be available inside
Swig as {{ candidates }}.

See the [quaff](https://github.com/rdmurphy/quaff) module for details.
